# BLACKNESS

### Drunken Prose from a darker time

I feel;

Like I am

Being swallowed by a BLACKNESS.

Apathy and procrastinatory aspirations

Breed and fester upon my shadowy

Corpse.

Like leeches, they suck and drain

The physical dopamine that would

Normally fuel my happiness.

I am lost in a world,

Populated with few people and yet I fail

To pay them attention.

Selfish am I,

To succomb to such a BLACKNESS and

To be so callous as to not care for

Those who are so close?

I do not know,

For I have lost my way.

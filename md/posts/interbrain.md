Your brain is a processing unit that is a part of the Internet.

Here, I'm not referring to the physical and technical meanings of the word Internet: a network of networks connecting digital computers. I mean the Internet in the way that humans experience it, which doesn't have its own word yet. Darn! [If someone could only come up with a term that captures its ability to send and receive information from anywhere to anywhere nearly instantaneously](https://benboyle.ca/the-case-for-the-teleportal). Any ideas?

## The BPU

In a way, your brain is connected via a bus like a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) is connected via [PCIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express). It is a *BPU*: *brain processing unit* or, perhaps, *biological processing unit*.

Your brain gives and receives information via [Human Interface Devices (HIDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device). It gives information to your computer with touchscreens, mice, keyboards, controllers, cameras, microphones, etc., and receives information in the form of light from the display, sound from the speakers (or headphones), and vibration from the haptics device (some may not consider all of these as proper HIDs: I don't care. I like the term and I'm rolling with it).

> Note: smartphones are computers too

The bandwidths of these human interface buses are not well-defined and indeed vary from human to human (not the bandwidth of HID to computer; that is well-defined. The bandwidth of brain to computer).

Some people, like myself, are slow at reading. Some can listen to speech at high speeds. Some can pay better attention when they have an audio, visual, and textual presentation, like a captioned video. Some people are slow at typing or have difficulty seeing small differences of light.

We have established that your brain has input and output (I/O) with your computer, and we know that your computer has I/O with a very large number of computers on the Internet. Thus, **your brain is indirectly accessible via the Internet**.

## The Network

Many of the computers on the Internet have human users who also have I/O with their computer and, therefore, their brain is also accessible via the Internet. Indirectly, through many computers and routers and switches and cables and antennas, **your brain is accessible by and can access every other brain connected to the Internet**.

So, we have this massive Inter-network of BPUs; who's sending them data to process across these buses?

Judging by the volume of traffic: TikTok, YouTube, Google, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. **The shareholders and executives of these platforms wield a Godly amount of power, as they have influence over the perception of reality for a significant number of the humans on Earth by influencing what information gets sent to them over the Internet**.

Analyzing what happens on these platforms, each BPU processes what it sees locally (both digitally and IRL) and becomes "excited" when it comes across something they consider important. The BPU then generates its own signal, and BPUs that are *close* (close in terms of degree of social connection) receive the signal. These close BPUs are simultaneously performing the same process: looking at signals coming from the unending stream and deciding if any of them are worth signalling others about. They will see the signals rebroadcasted from other close BPUs and decide ifÂ they want to rebroadcast it.

> Note: "rebroadcast" here doesn't necessarily mean "retweet" or "share". It could be that they "like" a post and then that post ends up in the feed of another close BPU because the platform thinks there is a high chance of them engaging with it as well. It could also be that they DM a link privately and the rebroadcasting is not visible on the outside

Social media could, *ideally*, serve as a [priority queue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA) where the highest priority things bubble up to the top. The Network could perceive as much of the natural world as possible via cameras, microphones, fitness trackers, weather stations, IoT devices, seismometers; sensors of all kinds. It could then **compute the most important thing that everyone should be acting on *right now* by having a massive network of BPUs aided by AI models filtering and prioritizing everything happening in parallel at each level of social closeness**. Echoes of this actually happen now and again, like with the Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, most of the time, this does not happen. It is rare to find any amount of unanimous consensus on today's platforms. We have a terrible blight of misinformation and not enough credible information to overcome it. The things that make it to the top are rarely optimal when considering what should most humans be paying attention to *right now*. It is more often what is most likely to excite the emotional weak points in these BPUs which causes them to generate infected, malformed signals that cause cascading disruptions and damage to the Network.

## The Interbrain

Let's revisit that structure of BPUs forming a network. If you squint, **this begins to resemble the structure of neurons in the brain**, where neurons become excited and pass on signals as reactions to signals from other close neurons with its own filter and conditions applied.

Thus, it seems that **the point of this whole "Internet" is to construct a higher order brain made up of entire human brains as its neurons and the Internet as its axons**. An organ made of complex organisms and distributed across the body of Earth.

Right now, this brain is not well-developed. Large cortices of neurons don't communicate with each other because they don't know how to interpret the other's signals, or they misinterpret the other's signals, or the connection between the cortices is damaged, or a connection hasn't been made yet.

As hinted at above, the nervous system connected to this brain is also in development. This brain will be able to remember and react to more and more as its sensory and memory infrastructure is built.

This brain is confused. It needs to wake up from its spell of confusion and put out the fires consuming its body.

We, the cells of this brain, are too busy trying to not die ourselves that we are often unable to act as a harmonious network and form a coherent thought that spans this great Inter-network.

It is not yet conscious of itself, and far far away from being able to understand the nature of its existence. Who knows what that even means? How is a neuron capable of observing the structure of the entire brain?

It might be different this time. This time, the primitives are self-aware, and they have very sophisticated tools to capture and analyze information of the natural world.

Hope is an infectious thing, after all.

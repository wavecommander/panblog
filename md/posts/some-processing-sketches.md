% Some Processing Sketches

I made some sketches using [Processing (p5.js)](https://p5js.org/) a while back and finally got around to polishing them and tweaking them to work on my site.

These are little bits of Javascript that draw things in the viewport. These ones only draw squares as I was just messing with them.

They look best in fullscreen so click on their names to load them on their own page if you like. The source code is in script tags in the HTML.

Enjoy!

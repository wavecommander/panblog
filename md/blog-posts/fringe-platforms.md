% An Investigation of Fringe Platforms
16 Oct 2021

I think I have a less than common perspective on the truly dangerous current political landscape. I was a little surprised at the storm of the Capitol on 6 Jan 2021 (I watched it live); more surprised that it mostly stopped there and more people weren't killed [as there were attempts at organizing nationwide armed protests](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/11/politics/fbi-bulletin-armed-protests-state-us-capitol/index.html).
If you haven't seen the actual attack itself, I recommend [this amazing page by ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/), showing a large collection of Parler content that was archived before [it was taken offline](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/parler-drops-offline-after-amazon-withdraws-support.html), as well as [this compilation put together by an incognito alt-right YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwiVr2xkUEw).

In continuation of the motive behind my seminal [*Dealing with Monsters*](dealing-with-monsters.html) post, I will continue to act as a "bridge to the other side" and provide a level of depth not observed by journalists.


### Fringe Searching Tips

If you want to do your own searching, I recommend first searching on Google but also searching on Bing or another alternative search engine as Google actively censors extremist and fringe results. I have recently found QAnon sources and the Gab social network being censored. I have also had messages deleted/filtered on Facebook platforms that contain such links; usually the old replace '.' with '(dot)' works (lol, good job guys).


### List of Platforms

I started a search to see what alternative platforms fringe groups are using to propagate information. So far I have found 
[private Facebook Groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/technology/facebook-private-groups-alex-jones.html), 
[Discord](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/05/983855753/group-chat-app-discord-says-it-banned-more-than-2-000-extremist-communities), 
[Telegram](https://www.vox.com/recode/22238755/telegram-messaging-social-media-extremists), [DLive](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/technology/dlive-capitol-mob.html), 
[Parler (revived)](https://parler.com/main.php), 
[BitChute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01984.pdf), 
[LBRY and Minds](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/technology/big-tech-power-bitcoin.html), 
[Odysee](https://gnet-research.org/2021/02/17/odysee-the-new-youtube-for-the-far-right/), 
[Gab, Rumble, and MeWe](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/01/14/the-far-right-is-flocking-to-these-alternate-social-media-apps---not-all-of-them-are-thrilled/?sh=79c0684655a4).
Obviously not *all* the users and groups on these platforms are "fringe", but these platforms are are either neutral or ***actively encouraging*** their presence.

## Alex Jones and Banned.Video

Alex Jones is a very well known example of a fringe propagandist who independently built his own empire and has survived being taken off of every major platform.

It was widely reported on when [Alex Jones was booted off mainstream platforms in 2018](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories). I had not heard anything on the matter since he was on Joe Rogan's Podcast and I imagined that they had some self-hosted contingincy.

On [InfoWars.com](https://www.infowars.com/), I found out about such platform; 
[Banned.Video](https://banned.video/). It seems to have flown under the radar as I cannot find any media converage on it whatsoever. Looking at [the Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/) there are [captures dating back to 28 Sep 2019](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928215013/https://banned.video/). It is essentially a YouTube copy where uploaders have to go through 
[an exclusive application process](https://www.banned.video/upload).

From the [Banned.Video uploader application process page](https://www.banned.video/upload)

Just browsing the frontpage of Banned.Video for the first time I saw a video titled 
*Is it true that Ivermectin and HCQ are abortion-tainted just like COVID jabs?*[https://www.banned.video/watch?id=6169dd060ea2554a4166fc5e]; yes, you read that right. It comes from *The John-Henry Westen Show* and the syndication he is apart of, 
[*LifeSite News*](https://www.lifesitenews.com/).
Just looking at that homepage, it is populated with anti vaccine[^lsn-archive][^lsn-vac1][^lsn-vac2][^lsn-vac3][^lsn-vac4] and anti abortion[^lsn-abort1][^lsn-abort2] "articles", most of them published within the last few days.






[^lsn-archive]: If these LifeSite News pages become unavailable, they should all be on the Web Archive. I checked and they are as of 16 Oct 2021.

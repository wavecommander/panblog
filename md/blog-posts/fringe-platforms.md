% An Investigation of Fringe Platforms
16 Oct 2021

I think I have a less than common perspective on the truly dangerous current political landscape. I was a little surprised at the storm of the Capitol on 6 Jan 2021 (I watched it live); more surprised that it mostly stopped there and more people weren't killed [as there were attempts at organizing nationwide armed protests](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/11/politics/fbi-bulletin-armed-protests-state-us-capitol/index.html).
If you haven't seen the actual attack itself, I recommend [this amazing page by ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/), showing a large collection of Parler content that was archived before [it was taken offline](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/parler-drops-offline-after-amazon-withdraws-support.html), as well as [this compilation put together by an incognito alt-right YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwiVr2xkUEw).

In continuation of the motive behind my seminal [*Dealing with Monsters*](dealing-with-monsters.html) post, I will continue to act as a "bridge to the other side" and inform people about the things they aren't seeing on their mainstream media channels.

I started a search to see what alternative platforms fringe groups are using to propagate information. So far I have found [private Facebook Groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/technology/facebook-private-groups-alex-jones.html), [Discord](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/05/983855753/group-chat-app-discord-says-it-banned-more-than-2-000-extremist-communities), [Telegram](https://www.vox.com/recode/22238755/telegram-messaging-social-media-extremists), [DLive], [Parler (revived)](https://parler.com/main.php), [BitChute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01984.pdf), LBRY, Gab, Rumble, and MeWe. Obviously not *all* the users and groups on these platforms are "fringe", but these platforms are are either neutral or ***actively*** encouraging their presence.

It was widely reported on when [Alex Jones was booted off mainstream platforms in 2018](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/6/17655658/alex-jones-facebook-youtube-conspiracy-theories). I had not heard anything on the matter since he was on Joe Rogan's Podcast and I imagined that they had a self-hosted backup. On [InfoWars.com](https://www.infowars.com/), I found out about Banned.Video. It is essentially a YouTube copy where uploaders have to go through [an application process](https://www.banned.video/upload).

On the frontpage of Banned.Video, I saw a video titled ""

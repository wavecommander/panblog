# American Pie

I am thankful to be in the same universe this song was written. I don't know if I can fully put into words everything that it means to me; some of it probably sounds crazy.

> Oh, and while the king was looking down<br>
The jester stole his thorny crown<br>
The courtroom was adjourned<br>
No verdict was returned

I've said it before and I'll say it again, these lyrics are describing the American revolution in the face of the British Empire. No verdict was returned because we are still seeing this experiment play out.

# Komm SÃ¼sser Tod

My favorite description of depression in a work of art to date.

It has a cheerful seeming exterior with a defeated harshness underneath.

>It just keeps tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down

This lyric means many things at once. The failure of the most important tasks and relationships. It echoes Sisyphus' endless punishment as the stone tumbles down unavoidibly. And in combination with "It all returns to nothing", the heat death of the universe comes to mind. The continual phenomena of all matter to prefer lower energy states and "tumble down".

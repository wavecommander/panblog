<p>6 Jun 2022 MP</p>
<p>It’s been a while. 260 days exactly.</p>
<p>I would like to apologize to everyone who has visited this website. <a href="https://github.com/wavecommander/panblog/commit/7d228995cf82c1e2ceb2ec205fc8bae85e9d739e">I put Google Analytics tracking on this website on 5 Dec 2020</a>. I wanted to get some data about the number of users visiting this site, what pages they were viewing, how long they were staying etc.</p>
<p>I have been conflicted about this decision since I made it. I have not been paying my website enough attention, and now that I have restructured it, this was the first change I wanted to make.</p>
<p>I am sorry. I will not add any invasive tracking Javascript to this website ever again.</p>
<p>With that out of the way: hello!</p>
<p>I am doing very well since I last posted a personal update. The biggest news is that I graduated from UPEI with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science! It is wonderful having that done and out of the way. I completed Computer Graphics I and II, as well as Video Game Engine Architecture as electives in my final year. Computer graphics is so so so much fun! I have made <a href="https://github.com/wavecommander/city">my city project public on GitHub</a>. If you want a textbook recommendation, <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/"><em>Real-time Rendering</em></a> was an excellent resource.</p>
<p>I have been taking a break since I finished my schoolwork; my days consist of eating, programming, reading, and meeting with friends.</p>
<p>I recently reached out to The Rural highschool and will be planning new things for the computing club that has thankfully survived while I was forced to take a break due to personal health and university studies.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found <a href="meta-ramblings-1.html#something-warm">something warm</a>. It has been six months since our first date. Things have been going very well.</p>
<p>I will certainly have some more meaty content on here soon. I have had a few posts on the back burner for months and months. I will be cleaning them up and finishing them in the coming months.</p>
<p>I also have a couple of programs that I will be making open source on my GitHub; I will make accompanying posts here.</p>
<p>Hopefully you noticed the restructuring of this site. No longer are dates the primary key used to sort posts; it is now the tier of importance or their type. This is an instance of me attempting to do as I say: prioritize the information you broadcast. The next addition will be a minimal tagging system where visitors can Ctrl-F the post index for tags they want to search for.</p>

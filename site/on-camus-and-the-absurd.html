<h1 class="title">On Camus and The Absurd</h1>
</header>
<p>16 Jul 2021</p>
<p><img src="./images/sisyphus.png" /></p>
<p>I am interested in Absurdist philosophy. So much so that I got a tattoo, which I designed, symbolizing Sisyphus and his eternal struggle. I think it was a case of receiving just the right message at just the right time. This past summer has been a very formative experience, and reading the works of Albert Camus kept me afloat in many ways.</p>
<p><img src="./images/sisyphus_tattoo.jpg" /></p>
<p>This post will serve as a revisiting of the philosophy that inspired me and as a chance to formalize my ideas surrounding it with words.</p>
<p>I read both <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> (1955) and <em>The Stranger</em> (1942). While <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> was a much denser read, because of its more direct and bare logical nature, I feel I actually got a lot more of the philosophical ideas presented. I found the entire contents of <em>The Stranger</em> can be summed up by the first few sections of <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>. I suspect I am missing the significance of <em>The Stranger</em> and I don’t think I process information in novel form as well as I can follow an argument.</p>
<p>This post will mainly concern Absurdism as it is described from the ground up in <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>, I do not have much other experience outside of a few Wikipedia pages.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-absurdism">Summary of Absurdism</h2>
<p>I will start by summarizing what I have gathered from my cursory study of the philosophy.</p>
<p>A large part of Absurdism is the acceptance that your life, the lives of others, and the world you live in are all finite; the realization and acceptance that you are playing a game where you a free to make up the rules; there are no judgemental referees. There is no inherent meaning to be found in the universe, only what you make yourself, and even then, time will take that away as well.</p>
<h3 id="defining-the-absurd">Defining <strong>The Absurd</strong></h3>
<p>The Absurd is the relationship and constant tension between the universe, devoid of inherent meaning, and humans, conscious creatures that constantly seek meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Camus enumerates many of the feelings and consequences of The Absurd to try and get at the heart of it. It is the problem that a conscious man is faced with upon his disillusion. The discovery of it produces the kind of existential questioning we are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-myth-of-sisyphus">On <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></h2>
<p>Taken from the preface of <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This interpretation is very much in line with my own. I felt very alone this past summer for a myriad of reasons; I found myself in a desert more than once. Reading this book inspired me to make the most out of every moment, bathe in the summer sun before winter could take it away, and chase after many mates as a virile male, a <strong><em>Don Juan</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the argumentation in <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> deals with the problem of suicide, the refutation of contemporary philosophies, and laying out what it means to be an Absurd man and create Absurd art.</p>
<p>When faced with the realization that there is no inherent meaning to your existence and that everything you know will eventually be obliterated, it is natural to wonder, “Why not just quit now?”</p>
<p>But to end your existence short is to deny yourself the opportunity to rebel in the face of The Absurd, to play the game on your own terms. I will expand on this in the following subsection.</p>
<h3 id="suicide-proper">Suicide Proper</h3>
<p>During his argumentation, Camus builds the notion that we are isolated from the world with our personal perspective and that we cannot find ultimate meaning in the world.</p>
<p>He deals with suicide directly after much preparation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues this acceptance of The Absurd and seizing the opportunity to accept your experience is a form of revolt/rebellion against the human condition, a sort of personal vendetta to keep your consciousness alive and laugh in the face of the cold and indifferent world simply because you feel like it. One who accepts the absurd condition concludes that they have ultimate freedom in how they decide to live every second; there are no referees, no rulebook. Perhaps this is not enough to convince those that find life to be unbearable suffering, and I would not discount that. Camus is engaging with suicide at an intellectual level: he argues about it as a primarily logical problem that can be reasoned about as a philosopher rather than the terrible last result contemplated by a crushed soul.</p>
<h3 id="philosophical-suicide">Philosophical Suicide</h3>
<p>Camus argues that competing theistic philosophies commit <em>Philosophical Suicide</em>, a sort of throwing up your hands at attempting to reason and just leave at “it must be divine.”</p>
<p>I do not know exactly where I stand on this point. I think that it is permissible to theorize about divine planes beyond our own, but perhaps believing that there must exist some divine being is where the <em>Philosophical Suicide</em> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="exploration-and-extension">Exploration and Extension</h2>
<p>I think that Camus’ perspective may have been limited by his focus on contemporary philosophy and the decades between our existences. I would like to extend and question Absurdism, the up-to-date state of affairs as a human on this Earth.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics-and-science">Mathematics and Science</h3>
<p>In <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>, Camus rejects science as a way to learn about the world. He states that it is made up of descriptions and metaphors that are more art than science and that it offers only hypotheses and theories that approximate the truth but don’t embody it completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, in my mind, Camus missed the mark here entirely. It would appear he has not looked into empirically proven physics, and beyond that, mathematics. All of the sciences have much to teach about the world, and it is, in fact, <strong><em>the real world</em></strong> that it is teaching us about.</p>
<h3 id="transhumanism">Transhumanism</h3>
<p>In his day, it is safe to say that Camus was correct in his conclusion that he would not be able to transcend the human condition and that he was left to deal with its confines. I, on the other hand, see the rapid development of modern technology in my day and think that perhaps I, or some descendants of mine, will have an opportunity never before available to a human. An opportunity to shed this evolutionarily developed biological system for something more purpose-built and permissive as well as preserving consciousness well beyond what we consider a normal human lifespan.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-these-additional-perspectives-mean-for-the-human-condition-and-the-absurd-man">What Do These Additional Perspectives Mean for The Human Condition and The Absurd Man?</h4>
<p>I believe that these additional perspectives do not invalidate one’s potential to be an Absurd Man. I couldn’t imagine a better revolt than to transcend biology and reject suicide for as long as the being wishes. A person who holds these perspectives is still granted the absolute freedom that is given upon acceptance of The Absurd. As for passion, figuring out the world and all of the things in it is quite a passionate affair.</p>
